// Redux is also great, but make sure that you get started using Redux Toolkit.

// The benefit of a library like Zustand is that it is small, makes your entire global state a custom hook, and to read or update state, you just call this hook in your components.

// To use Zustand, run npm install zustand. After that, make a dedicated store file or folder and create your store:

// One large reason I recommend using Zustand over a library like Redux is that it gives you all the functionality you need without the boilerplate and conceptual overhead of actions, reducers, and so on.

// Plus, you donâ€™t need to wrap your components in a Context Provider. Just install and go!
